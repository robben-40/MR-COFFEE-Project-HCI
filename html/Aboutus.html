            <p>Susanto Liman, the heart and soul behind MR.COFFEE, was once a traveler with a deep love for coffee and human connection. After years of exploring remote villages and tasting rare brews, he dreamed of a place where coffee wasn’t just a drink—but a bridge between people. With a small savings and a big vision, he opened MR.COFFEE in the heart of the city, filling it with mismatched chairs, local art, and an unshakable belief that every cup should tell a story.</p>

        <h2><span class="blue">Company</span> Story</h2>
        <p>What began as a tiny shop with creaky floors and doodle-covered walls soon became a sanctuary for dreamers, artists, and wanderers. The aroma of ethically sourced beans and the hum of laughter turned MR.COFFEE into a local legend. Now, Susanto’s dream expands—bringing the same warmth online, so no matter where you are, you can always pull up a chair (virtual or real) and feel at home.</p>
